# Dear_Indian_Education_System
This is a private education system full of detailed plans for people who are willing to be a self taught computer engineer or achive mastry on some skills or fileds like Maths and Science and Technology [STEM]

This repository which will contain possibly best online learning source with a well planned and organized manner with some instrcutions on how to make it more effective and fun learning. 

We are with a goal to make a self made educations system! 

This system is mostly for Indian but anyone can follow these plans. I do not promish any kind of success rate or something from this plan and people following this plan for reasons other then "Passion and A aruge from inside to learn" should not follow this. but still one can! 

So Let's get started:
1) First thing First you needed to be Good in Maths and Science and if you are not and in high school or middel school then here are instructions and few resources. 
  a) Improve your concentartion. To do that you needed to be doing one thing at a time means you should avoid multi tasking for more detailed explanation on this go and watch this tedtalk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4O2JK_94g3Y [UNWAVERING FOCUS] 
  b)You need to recover your loss of your eariler classes if you have passed a class this do not mean anything you need to know everything to learn on future. To construct a bulding you need to finish the base first and then the level 1 and then the level 2 and so on. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-MTRxRO5SRA [For more detailed explanation a view on this video]. 
  c)here are the list of sources: khanacademy.org (This site conatin more then 50 languages) so one can be benifical for non-english students also. https://khanacademy.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202483750-Is-Khan-Academy-available-in-other-languages- 
  d) For practicing what you are learning i will prefer https://brilliant.org and https://artofproblemsolving.com/ you can use brilliant.org wiki to learn more stuffs in detail which are not on khan academy( yeah they just prefer to explain the concept but not all the key terms). 
# if you will be doing all these properly then you will be achiving mastery on subjects like Physics , Chemistry and Maths. one of my key point will be if you will not be able to memorize something then you don't even need it so better to forget 
# This part mainly contain High School education which is actually needed for futher education. 

2)If you future wants to study in Maths and Science not CS then this may be not the best content here. but still am listing down some stuffs and resources for maths and science you can have more deatiled talk on that on freenode IRC channel on #math , #Physics and #Chemistry if you are not familire with IRC's not a big deal its just a simple old social media which is text based. 
https://github.com/rossant/awesome-math [here you can have list of required sources to study maths in deatils]. 
3) Now here we Go for CS now CS actually includes a lot of cources and other stuffs you can get a lot of good learning platform about that from awesome.re which actually include a lot of learning resources. by the ways i will be talking in deatils about learning CS in the another file here i am just leaving with the resource awesome.re and taughtyourselfcs.com which are actually best one sponsered by peoples from university and other places.
